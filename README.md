## **AI-Based Age Detection for Personalized Advertising Using Embedded Systems**

This project focuses on enhancing marketing strategies using computer vision to detect a user's age group through facial analysis. By processing real-time visual input using embedded systems, the solution delivers age-appropriate advertisements dynamically. The system can function offline, ensuring data privacy and fast inference suitable for kiosks, malls, and digital signage environments.

### **ðŸ“¸ How It Works**

1. **Capture Input:**
   Real-time image or video feed from a connected camera.

2. **Detect Face and Age:**
   Use a deep learning model to analyze the face and predict the age.

3. **Classify Age Group:**
   Age is categorized into a group:

   * `Child (0â€“12)`
   * `Teen (13â€“19)`
   * `Adult (20â€“59)`
   * `Senior (60+)`

4. **Display Ad Content:**
   System maps the age group to an ad and displays it instantly.

5. **Repeat in Real-Time:**
   Continuously monitor and update content as people change.
